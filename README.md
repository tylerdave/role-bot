# role-bot

Role Bot is an Amazon Alexa skill that provides some basic functionality that could be useful to RPG players. This is mainly a project for fun.

In the Alexa app, it is titled "Role Bot: The RPG Assistant" so search for something like that if you'd like to find it.

## Code

I plan to release the code for this skill once I clean it up a bit. It will be pushed to this repo when that happens.
